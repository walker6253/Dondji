## 1.3 Scanning

### Scan Memory Channel List

1. Assign each channel to a scan list first: via the web “Programming” page, or menu **Channels → Channel List**.
2. **MENU** → **Other → Scan List**, choose the list to scan.
3. On the main screen in **channel mode**, **long press `*`** or **`F+*`** to start scanning.
4. When a signal is found, press **MENU** to stop on that channel; with no signal, **MENU** / **EXIT** both exit the scan.

### One-Key Scan and Tone Scan

1. **Long `4`** or **`F+4`**: One-key frequency scan.
2. In **frequency mode**, **`F+*`**: Scan for tone (CTCSS/DCS).

After a result, follow the on-screen **MENU** → “Save?” → (in MR mode, pick channel number) → **MENU** again to write to a memory channel. **EXIT** cancels.

### Range Scan and Spectrum Entry

1. Switch to **dual watch** (range scan is unavailable in single watch).
2. Set both A and B to **frequency mode**.
3. Enter start frequency on A, end frequency on B.
4. **Long `5`**: Start range scan (long press **EXIT** to exit).
5. **`F+5`**: Enter spectrum page (see 1.6).

### Exclude Channel During Scan

While paused on a channel during a scan, **long press MENU** can exclude that channel from the current scan (per firmware prompt).

### Related Menus

| Menu | Purpose |
|------|------|
| Scan List | Choose default list / all, etc. |
| Priority Scan, Priority Channel | Priority channel |
| Scan Resume | Stop on signal / carrier / timeout, etc. |
| Channel List | Whether a channel joins a scan list |

---

## 1.4 Saving Channels

Write the current frequency and parameters to a memory channel.

### Method 1: Menu “Save Channel”

1. On the main screen, set frequency, tone, power, modulation, offset, etc.
2. Short press **MENU** → **Save Channel (ChSave)** → **MENU** again.
3. Use **↑/↓** or enter a channel number to pick the target channel.
4. Press **MENU** → when “Confirm?” appears, press **MENU** again to finish.

To delete: menu **Delete Channel (ChDele)**, with confirmation.

You can also bulk-import channels on the web “Programming” page.

### Method 2: After Editing in Channel Mode — You MUST Save Again

In **channel mode (MR)**, when you change that channel’s tone, power, bandwidth, etc. via the menu:

- Changes may take effect **immediately** while you stay on that channel;
- **If you do NOT run Save Channel (ChSave) again, switching channels or powering off will discard the changes** — they are treated as temporary only.

**Correct workflow:** After any parameter change in MR mode, run **Save Channel (ChSave)** again to write the current settings back to that memory channel. **This step is mandatory; skipping it means your edits are not kept.**

### Method 3: Save Scan Results

After one-key scan or tone scan, follow the on-screen “Save?” flow (see 1.3).

---

## 1.5 Channel Naming and Pinyin Input

### Enter Naming

1. **MENU** → **Name Channel (ChName)**.
2. Select a valid channel → **MENU** to edit.
3. When done, short press **MENU** to move the cursor; at the end, confirm “Confirm?” to save.
4. Channel name is up to **10 bytes** (one character per English letter; about **5 Chinese characters**). Without Chinese characters, dual-watch may swap frequency and channel-name positions (see FAQ #3).

> Chinese display requires the font pack and **Display → Display Language** set to Chinese.

### Input Modes

On the naming screen, short press **`#` (F)** to cycle modes (Chinese UI often starts in Pinyin):

| Mode | Description |
|------|------|
| Pinyin | T9 Pinyin → pick Chinese character |
| Lower / Upper | Multi-tap letters |
| Numbers | Digits only |
| Symbols | Symbol page |

Tips:

- Pinyin: use **2–9** for T9 syllable digits; **↑/↓** for candidates; **\*** backspace.
- Outside Pinyin, long press `#` inserts `#`; long press a digit forces that digit.

#### Pinyin Key Map (T9)

| Key | Letters |
|------|------|
| **2** | A B C |
| **3** | D E F |
| **4** | G H I |
| **5** | J K L |
| **6** | M N O |
| **7** | P Q R S |
| **8** | T U V |
| **9** | W X Y Z |

Example: for “山” (shan), try `7426`, then pick from candidates.

---

## 1.6 Spectrum

On the main screen, **`F+5`** opens the spectrum.

### Display mode: Simple / Expert

Before entering the spectrum, choose the UI style in the menu:

1. Short press **MENU** → find **Spectrum Display (SpDisp)** → press **MENU** again.
2. Use **↑/↓** to select, then **MENU** to confirm:

| Option | Description |
|------|------|
| **Simple** | Spectrum plot sits lower; frequency cursor has guide lines and scale ticks — easier to read for everyday scanning |
| **Expert** | Denser layout with more room for parameters/markers above — better when you need more detail at once |

This setting is stored in configuration (SPI `0x00A148`) and is included in config backup/restore.

![Spectrum screen](images/频谱.jpg)

**Spectrum keys:**

| Key | Function |
|------|------|
| **Number keys** | |
| `0` | Switch modulation (FM/AM/USB) |
| `1` / `7` | Increase/decrease scan step |
| `2` / `8` | Increase/decrease frequency step |

## 1.7 Toolbox (F+7)

On the main screen, **`F+7`** opens the **Toolbox** (not the brick-breaker game):

| Item | Description |
|------|------|
| **Electronic wooden fish** | Fun tap sound |
| **cw** | Morse practice / related features |

**EXIT** leaves the toolbox.

---

## 1.8 MDC ID and TX Tail Tone

Current firmware still uses **MDC1200** (Yan ID replacement is in the design doc; **not yet implemented**).

1. **MENU** → **Other** → **TX Tail (Roger)**: **Off / ROGER / MDC**.
2. With **MDC** selected, edit the 4-digit hex unit ID in the **MDC ID** menu.
3. When the other station sends MDC and local Roger is MDC, the main screen can show an **MDC ID** receive alert.

In config backup, MDC ID is at SPI `0x00A172` (2 bytes); see Chapter 2 address table.

---

## 1.9 Usage Notes

- During TX/RX the voltage meter may jump with current — normal (see FAQ #13).
- Use this site or verified tools for programming and calibration; address layout is not compatible with other firmware.
- Flashing and calibration backup steps are in Chapter 2.

---

# Chapter 2 — Firmware & Flashing

Welcome to the **Dondji flashing website**. This chapter covers browser backup/restore of calibration, flashing firmware and font pack, config, programming, boot logo, and storage addresses.

## 2.1 Preparation and Recommended Order

1. Use **Chrome** or **Edge** (Web Serial required).
2. Connect the radio to the PC with the factory programming cable.
3. **Before your first third-party flash**, back up calibration on **factory firmware, normal power-on main screen** (not BOOT mode).

**Recommended order:**

1. Back up calibration (factory firmware, normal boot)  
2. Flash firmware (BOOT mode: power off, hold **PTT**, then power on)  
3. Flash font pack (normal boot; needed for Chinese menu/channel names)  
4. Verify / restore calibration (normal boot)  
5. Programming / boot image / config backup (as needed)  

Follow each step on the matching website tab.

## 2.2 Back Up Calibration

Calibration holds RSSI, battery voltage, VOX, and other hardware parameters critical for normal operation.

**Steps:**

1. Power on normally to the main operating screen (not BOOT)
2. Connect USB
3. On the web page, choose “Back Up Calibration”
4. Click “Export Calibration Data”
5. Download `calibration.dat` (512 bytes)

**Technical details:**

- Device info request auto-detects firmware version and calibration address  
- **Calibration EEPROM logical address:**
  - Firmware **v5.0.0 and above**: `0xB000`
  - Firmware **below v5.0.0**: `0x1E00`
- Read 16 bytes per transfer, 512 bytes total  
- Physically stored on SPI Flash `0x010000`–`0x0101FF` (see 2.5)

## 2.3 Restore Calibration

**Steps:**

1. Normal boot to main screen  
2. Connect USB → “Restore Calibration”  
3. Select your `calibration.dat` (must be 512 bytes)  
4. Click restore; device reboots when done  

**Important:**

- ⚠️ **Only backup files from this site and UVTools2 are supported**  
- ⚠️ **Must be normal boot before restore** — not in flash BOOT mode  
- Auto reboot after write completes  

**Technical details:** Same version detection and addresses as backup; 16 bytes per write; reboot command after completion.

## 2.4 Calibration Addresses and Data Layout

**Storage locations:**

| Medium | Address Range | Purpose | Size |
|---------|---------|------|------|
| EEPROM logical | `0x1E00` (v4+) | Calibration | 512B |
| EEPROM logical | `0xB000` (v5+) | Calibration | 512B |
| SPI Flash | `0x010000` – `0x010200` | Calibration backup area | 512B |

**Why addresses changed:** From v5.0.0, calibration moved from `0x1E00` to `0xB000`; the web tool auto-detects version. Both logical addresses map to the same SPI region.

**Calibration structure (offsets within calibration area):**

- `+0xC0` ~ `+0xD0`: RSSI  
- `+0x140` ~ `+0x14C`: Battery voltage  
- `+0x150` ~ `+0x160`: VOX sensitivity  
- `+0x168` ~ `+0x178`: VOX threshold  
- `+0x188` ~ `+0x198`: Crystal, volume gain, etc.  

**Compatibility:** Formats from different sites may not match; back up before reflashing; bad calibration can show as erratic battery, wrong signal readings, garbled display, etc.

## 2.5 Back Up and Restore Configuration

Config data covers menu settings for quick restore after factory reset. **Does not include channel frequencies/names, calibration, or font pack.**

### Use Cases

1. Export via web “Back Up Config”  
2. “Restore Config” when needed  

### Back Up Config

1. Normal boot → USB → “Back Up Config” → “Export Config Data”  
2. Get `config_backup.dat` (512 bytes)  

**Technical:** SPI physical start `0x00A000`, size 512 bytes (`0x200`); read in blocks.

### Restore Config

1. Normal boot → “Restore Config” → select backup → write → auto reboot

1. Menu **Display → Boot Screen**.  
2. Options:  
   - **Off**: No boot animation  
   - **Default**: Gorilla / voltage / sound, etc.; **boot prompt / boot sound options apply only in Default**  
   - **Custom**: Shows image uploaded on the website  

## 2.8 Flashing FAQ

(Full FAQ is in Chapter 3; flashing-related items here.)

1. **English UI right after flash?**  
   Flash the matching font pack and set **Display → Display Language** to Chinese.

2. **Bricked?**  
   Wrong firmware for your radio? Other programming/calibration tools? Address layouts differ by firmware — programming tools are not interchangeable. Follow this site’s steps.

3. **Others’ font OK but missing glyphs?**  
   Font/firmware version mismatch, or browser cached an old font — clear cache and reflash.

4. **Password when flashing back to factory?**  
   **Other → Factory Reset → OEM** → confirm → power off when you see “PWR OFF” → flash stock with official CPS. This wipes the AES programming-key sector so CPS usually won’t ask for a password. See the same tutorial in the site’s Emergency Toolbox. WeChat group help via the site’s floating button is recommended.

5. **Snow screen / erratic battery / wrong voltage?**  
   Bad calibration: restore factory calibration; if no backup, use factory calibration from the web page.

# Chapter 3 — FAQ & Other

## 3.1 Frequently Asked Questions

1. **What does “Use xxx” mean under Channels → Power?**  
   Answer: It reflects a custom power level set in **Other → Set Power**.

2. **English UI right after flashing?**  
   Answer: Flash the matching font pack and set **Display → Display Language** to Chinese.

3. **Dual channel: sometimes channel name below, sometimes frequency?**  
   Answer: By design. Without Chinese in the name, the lower line shows frequency and the upper corner shows the channel name. Names are up to ~5 Chinese characters (~15 English letters); when space is tight, display positions swap.

4. **Bricked?**  
   Answer: Wrong firmware for your radio? Other programming tools or random calibration edits? Did you follow the web flash steps exactly?  
   > Memory layouts differ by firmware; programming software is not universal. Unverified tools — risk is on you.

5. **Others’ font fine but I’m missing characters?**  
   Answer: Font/firmware version mismatch or cached old file in the browser. Clear cache and reflash the matching version.

6. **Wrong FM radio band?**  
   Answer: On the radio screen use **`1` / long `1` / `F+1`** to switch country band. See [1.2](#12-fm-radio).

7. **K1 radio but system info shows K5?**  
   Answer: User customization. Hold **PTT** and the lower adjacent side key while powering on to unlock related options; pick the battery type for your model. UI usually shows K1 or K5 only (K5/K6 share the same chip, different shells).

8. **Changed tone or other settings — gone after switching channel or reboot?**  
   Answer: **In channel (MR) mode, after changing parameters you MUST save the channel again (ChSave). Otherwise changes are temporary only and will not survive a channel change or power cycle.** See [1.4](#14-saving-channels).

9. **Long press # locks keypad and PTT too?**  
   Answer: **Other → Lock Range** can lock keypad only or include PTT.

10. **Password when flashing back to factory?**  
    Answer: **Other → Factory Reset → OEM**, confirm, power off at “PWR OFF”, then flash stock with official CPS. See the Emergency Toolbox tutorial on this site. WeChat group via site floating button is recommended.

11. **Snow screen / jumping battery / wrong voltage?**  
    Answer: Calibration issue — restore factory calibration; use web factory calibration if no backup.

12. **FM radio: amateur signal sometimes exits radio, sometimes not?**  
    Answer: In dual watch, only the **main channel** interrupts and exits the radio. BK4819 cannot true dual-watch; it polls. Continuous polling in radio mode hurts FM quality and uses more power.

13. **Looks very power-hungry — battery drops visibly?**  
    Answer: TX/RX current swings move the voltage meter, like an old e-bike sagging when you twist the throttle. Normal. Some other firmwares freeze the battery display during TX so it looks “steadier.”

14. **What bands work with full unlock? Hardware limits?**  
    Answer: Limited by **BK4819**: Band1 ~18–630 MHz, Band2 ~84–1300 MHz; **630–840 MHz is a hardware dead zone** — firmware cannot bypass it.

    **Full unlock (F_LOCK_NONE) approximate ranges:**

    | Mode | Receive (RX) | Transmit (TX) |
    |------|-----------|-----------|
    | Standard | 50 MHz ~ 600 MHz | 50 MHz ~ 600 MHz |
    | Wide RX mode | 18 MHz ~ 1300 MHz (dead zone excluded) | 18 MHz ~ 600 MHz + 470 MHz ~ 1300 MHz |

    **Menu “Lock Band” common options (current firmware, including compile-time items):**

    | Mode | Notes (TX related) |
    |------|------------------|
    | Default | 137–174 / 400–470 |
    | FCC amateur | 144–148 / 420–450 |
    | CA amateur | 144–148 / 430–450 (if compiled) |
    | CE amateur | 144–146 / 430–440 |
    | GB amateur | 144–148 / 430–440 |
    | 137–174 / 400–430 | Band table |
    | 137–174 / 400–438 | Band table |
    | PMR 446 | If compiled |
    | GMRS/FRS/MURS | If compiled |
    | All disabled | TX blocked |
    | Full unlock | Must select ~**10 times** in menu to activate (anti-mistouch) |

    **Other:**

    - ~280 MHz is VHF/UHF boundary — affects filtering and PA gain  
    - Wide RX can listen SW up to 1.3 GHz; TX still follows band table limits
